(I don't use this repo for my Neovim configuration now that I have switched to Nix. You can now find my configuration here: https://github.com/malob/nixpkgs/tree/master/configs/nvim)

This is a repo of my [NeoVim](https://neovim.io) config files.

Notable features include:
* Configuration to let you basically replace `tmux` with `nvim`.
* A pretty great setup for coding TypeScript and plain old JS.
* A bunch of nice tools to make writing really nice.
* A bunch of nice aesthetic touches.

Below I've included a bit of documentation and some setup instructions, but the actual `*.vim` files also contain a lot of documentation.

# Setup instructions

## Dependencies
* The config expects a terminal emulator with truecolor support. I use [`kitty`](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/).
* Some of the aesthetic touches make use of [NerdFont](https://nerdfonts.com) icons. My preferred font is [FiraCode](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode).
* Both the denite.nvim and deoplete.nvim plugin requires the `neovim` Python 3 package.
```bash
pip3 install neovim
```
* Finally many of the language servers, as well as devdocs.vim require that `npm` is installed. (`brew install node` in macOS or `apt install nodejs` in Ubuntu.)

## Installation
Clone this repo to the correct location:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
git clone --recursive https://github.com/malob/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
~/.config/nvim/update.sh
```

## Installing, updating, and removing plugins
Plugins are located in the `bundle` folder and are added as `git` submodules. To update all plugins run `update.sh`, or simply press `u` on the neovim start screen.

To install a new plugin:
```bash
cd ~/.config/nvim/bundle
git submodule add [repo url]
```
To remove a plugin:
  * delete the relevent lines from `.gitmodules` and `.git/config`,
  * run `git rm --cached [plugin_folder]` and `rm -rf [plugin_folder]`,
  * then commit your changes.

## Tmux replacement setup
Have a look at the [tabs-and-panes.vim](tabs-and-panes.vim) file to understand the basics of the setup. To really get the most out of it I suggest getting the following tools:
* [neovim-remote](https://github.com/mhinz/neovim-remote)
  * This will allow you to open files in `nvim` from the neovim terminal without creating a nested neovim session.
  * Install it via `pip`: `pip3 install neovim-remote`.
  * Use `nvr [file]` to open a file from inside the neovim terminal.
  * It's a pretty powerful tool, so I recommend having a look at `nvr --help` to see what you can do with it.
* [abduco](https://github.com/martanne/abduco)
  * This will give you the ability to manage sessions that persist between shell sessions.

## Language Server and Linting Dependencies
Have a look in [completion-linting.vim](completion-linting.vim) for information on dependencies for various language servers and linters/fixers.
